DinoStudy is an app for young students to begin their journey in learning how to read. This app contains flashcards of many sight words that allow students to improve their abilities in recognizing common sight words. This app is intended to encourage young readers to an entertaining version of their reading practices and additionally allowing readers to practice their reading skills at home or when traveling with the accessibilty of this mobile app. 

### Purpose:
This app allows readers to increase their reading ability and focus. The goal is to give young students the ability to use technology to improve them rather than to cause disruption to their focus. The more focus improves, the better their reading abilities will become!  

### Creation:
This app was created in Apple's app development tool Xcode with the programming language SwiftUI. This app has a fonts that match the theme of the app to allow to feel more alive! The creative work and design aspect of this app was meant to draw in the attention of young readers to a more entertaining and engaging way of learing how to read. 

##### Three Game Modes:
Currently the app has 3 game modes. 
* Dino Study
* Word Fossils
* Word Wingz
All of these games were designed to be very easy and limit the challenges young readers have when they first begin reading. With the perfect balance of fun gameplay and not much resistence in difficulty when learning the reading skill, this app works efficiently to allow young readers to start their journey in reading.

Remember: The idea is to allow the readers to play with these words to learn them not necessarily to learn them first so they can play.

###### Dino Study:
Dino study is a simple flashcard game which allows the reader to memorize sight words on a flashcard so that the next time they see the word anywhere(especially in a book) they can recognize and identify the word.

##### Word Fossils:
Word Fossil is another easy game. In this game the theme is to search for 'word fossils'. The reader has to see the word displayed on the top of the screen and match it with the brown tile with the word on it. This tile is the sand and the white word is meant to be the word fossils. It is a very simple game but perfect for beginner readers who are just now building familiarity with these words.

##### Word Wingz:
Out of the three 3 modes Word Wingz was designed for a bit of a challenge. This game requires you to look at words that have the same endings and learn how all of them sound. Each beginning letter is meant to be a specific wing sauce that goes on the ending letters(those are the wings). Every sauce(beginning word) changes the whole word similar to how different sauces in wings give the wings a different taste.
